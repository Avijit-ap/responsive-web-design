# Task 2: Cafe Menu

Welcome to Task 2 of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course! ‚òïüç∞

In this task, I've created a Cafe Menu using HTML and CSS. This hands-on project has allowed you to practice various CSS properties while building a visually appealing and responsive menu for a cafe.

## Project Details

- **Files**:
    - [index.html](responsive-web-design/learn-basic-css-by-building-a-cafe-menu/index.html): HTML file for the Cafe Menu.

  - [styles.css](responsive-web-designlearn-basic-css-by-building-a-cafe-menu/styles.css): CSS file containing the styling for the menu.

- **Objective**: The goal of this task was to reinforce my understanding of basic CSS properties by applying them to a real-world scenario, creating a Cafe Menu with a visually appealing design.

## How to Use

1. Open the [index.html](responsive-web-design/learn-basic-css-by-building-a-cafe-menu/index.html) file to view the HTML structure of the Cafe Menu.
